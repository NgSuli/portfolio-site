        <section>
            <h3>🧠 Problem Framing: Reimagining Meal Planning for Real Life</h3>
            <p>Meal-prepping promised efficiency, but I found myself frustrated by the repetitiveness of eating the same
                thing every day. I wanted flexibility without the hassle, something that helped me:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maximize the ingredients I already had or make the most of my mismatched fridge ingredients</li>
                <li>Avoid decision fatigue after a long day</li>
                <li>Maintain control over how much time I spent cooking</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These pain points inspired the question, "What Should I Eat Tonight?", a product idea born from personal
                friction, designed to simplify everyday cooking decisions.</p>

                are not looking for rigid meal plans, they want responsive tools that match their energy levels, time
                constraints, and available ingredients.</p>

                sustainable choices. It could build a dynamic experience that is always evolving, helping users save
