        <h3><br> üß† Problem Framing: Reimagining Meal Planning for Real Life </h3>

        <p>Meal-prepping promised efficiency, but I found myself frustrated by the repetitiveness of eating the same
            thing every day. I wanted flexibility without the hassle, something that helped me:</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 28em;"> <br>‚Ä¢ Maximize the ingredients I already had or make the most of my
            mismatched fridge ingredients
            <br><br>‚Ä¢ Avoid decision fatigue after a long day
            <br><br> ‚Ä¢ Maintain control over how much time I spent cooking
        </p>
        <p><br>These pain points inspired the question, "What Should I Eat Tonight?", a product idea born from personal
            friction, designed to simplify everyday cooking decisions.</p> <br><br><br><br><br>
        </p>

        <h3> üéØ The Insight </h3>
        <p>In today‚Äôs fast-paced, post-pandemic world, many young adults are cooking more but planning less. They are
            not looking for rigid meal plans, they want responsive tools that match their energy levels, time
            constraints, and available ingredients. So I asked, "What if we could reduce the mental load of everyday
            cooking, while still giving people choice, variety, and control?" <br><br><br><br><br><br>

        </p>
        <h3>üí° Product Vision: Helping People Eat Better, Smarter, Easier </h3>
        <p> "What Should I Eat Tonight?" helps users generate recipe ideas based on what they already have and
            how much time they want to spend cooking. Here‚Äôs how it works: </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 28em;"><br>‚Ä¢ Users input the ingredients they have on hand
            <br><br> ‚Ä¢ They choose their preferred cooking time
            <br><br> ‚Ä¢ The app returns curated recipe options, complete with instructions
            <br><br>‚Ä¢ A built-in AI assistant helps answer questions or customize recipes
        </p>
        <p><br>By removing the friction of decision-making, the app frees up headspace, making mealtime less about
            stress and more about ease.
            <br><br><br><br><br><br>
        </p>
        </p>

        <h3>üîç Enhancing the Experience: Designing for Real Life & Future Expansion </h3>
        <p> My goal was not just to solve a meal planning problem for today, I wanted to explore how this tool could
            become a smart, supportive presence in everyday life. A system that is not just reactive, but proactively
            helpful.<br><br><br>

        </p>

        <h4>üõí 1. Smart Grocery Integration </h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 26em;"> To extend the app‚Äôs utility, I envisioned a deeper integration with grocery
            platforms, transforming meal planning into an end-to-end, intelligent system. The idea is: </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 30em;"><br>‚Ä¢ Automatically generate shopping lists from selected recipes
            <br><br>‚Ä¢ Suggest items based on budget constraints and personal preferences
            <br><br>‚Ä¢ Sync with grocery delivery apps for a seamless checkout experience
            <br><br>‚Ä¢Translate recipe quantities into relatable, visual terms, such as ‚Äúhalf a pack of spaghetti‚Äù or
            ‚Äúthree stalks of spring onion‚Äù instead of grams.
            <br><br>‚Ä¢ Track pantry inventory dynamically, adjusting available ingredients based on the recipes you have
            used
            <br><br> ‚Ä¢ Pre-plan and schedule grocery orders ahead of time based on your weekly meal plan
        <p style="margin-left: 26em;"> <br> This turns the app into a true meal-planning assistant, one that not only
            helps you cook tonight‚Äôs dinner, but also helps you plan the week, reduce food waste, and take control of
            your time and budget.</p>
        <h4 style="margin-left: 26em;"> ‚Üí Think: intuitive inventory meets forward-thinking logistics. </h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 26em;"><br><br> In future iterations, machine learning could enhance this further with:
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 30em;">‚Ä¢ Freshness tracking e.g., ‚ÄúUse your spinach by Thursday‚Äù
            <br><br> ‚Ä¢ Smart nudges e.g., ‚ÄúYou have leftover tomatoes and basil, how about pasta salad tomorrow?‚Äù
        </p>
        <h4 style="margin-left: 26em;"> ‚Üí Think: real-time fridge-to-recipe flow that feels effortless and smart.
        </h4>
        </p>
        </p> <br><br><br>

        </p>

        <h4>üèóÔ∏è 2. Building for Connection: A Community Layer </h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 26em;">Cooking is not just functional, it is emotional. I wanted to design a space where
            food could also become a way to stay close. Therefore, I imagined a community feature that enables users to:
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 30em;"> <br>‚Ä¢ Share recipes with loved ones
            <br><br>‚Ä¢ Discover what others are cooking in real time
            <br><br>‚Ä¢ Bond over food and stories, even when apart.
            <br><br>‚Ä¢ Effortlessly keep loved ones in the loop without needing to individually message or update them
            about
            what you are having
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 26em;"><br> Whether you are meal-prepping with a friend, checking what your partner is
            cooking tonight, or sharing grandma‚Äôs dumpling recipe, this feature brings people closer through food. It
            turns meal planning into a shared experience, not just a solo task.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        </p>

        <h3>‚úçÔ∏è Design Process: From Concept to Clickable </h3>
        <p>I started designing the product during the AWS PartyRock Hackathon,
            prototyping with generative AI
            to explore early proof of concept. To move from idea to interface, I followed these steps:
        <p style="margin-left: 30em;"><br>1. Low-Fidelity Sketching: Mapped out structure and user flow with quick
            paper sketches
            <br><br>2. Visual Direction: Developed a mood board and style guide to set tone and consistency
            <br><br>3. High-Fidelity UI: Refined font, color, and layout to build an interactive prototype in Figma
        </p>

        <h3>üî• Product Roadmap: From Friction to Flow</h3>
        <p>Having mapped out the core features and future potential of the product, I stepped back to consider how this
            experience might evolve, not just functionally but also emotionally and strategically. This roadmap captures
            the product‚Äôs transformation from a functional tool to a holistic assistant, blending intelligence,
            personalization, and emotional design to reshape how users plan, cook, and connect through meals.</p><br>

        <h3>
            ‚úÖ Measuring Success
        </h3>
        <p>Having laid out the roadmap, I also considered how we might measure success, not only in terms of
            functionality but also in how well the product supports real-life habits, decision-making, and emotional
            connection in the kitchen. If this were to move forward as a product, I would focus on:</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 30em;"> <br>‚Ä¢ Engagement rate: Are users returning within three days to explore more
            meals?
            <br><br> ‚Ä¢ Planning Behavior: Are users actively entering ingredients and planning ahead?
            <br><br> ‚Ä¢ From Idea to Action: Are users marking recipes as ‚Äúcooked‚Äù after clicking them?
            <br><br>‚Ä¢ Habit Formation: Are users saving recipes or maintaining consistent meal streaks over time?
        </p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
