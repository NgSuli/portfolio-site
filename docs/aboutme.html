<section class="about-me">
    <p>
        My passion lies at the intersection of design, technology, and business and how they shape user behavior and
        drive innovation. I want to explore how technology can transform lives and maybe even find the sweet spot where
        work and play meet. I am drawn to the entire product development journey, from uncovering what people really
        need to bringing ideas to life and watching them make an impact in the real world. I believe that balancing
        human-centered design with business goals is key to creating sustainable digital transformation.
        <br><br>With my head in the clouds üå®Ô∏è but grounded by experience in engineering and project management, I bring
        a practical yet
        imaginative approach to turning ideas into solutions that matter. Whether as a product manager, solution
        architect, service designer, or in a role I have not yet discovered, I am always building my skills in design,
        technology, and business to make a real difference and to have some fun along the way.
